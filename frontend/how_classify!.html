                    classify celestial objects.
                    Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (Dec) pinpoint an object's location on the celestial
                    sphere, similar to latitude and longitude on Earth. Magnitudes (u, g, r, i, z) measured
                    through different colored filters reveal an object's overall brightness and spectral
                    characteristics. By analyzing these values, astronauts can make educated guesses about an
                    object's nature. For instance, extended objects with faint overall
                    brightness (high magnitude values) and no significant variation across color filters might be
                    galaxies. Conversely, a single point-like source with significant brightness (low magnitude
                    values) across most filters could be a star. Additionally, objects with extremely high
                    redshifts (indicating they're very distant) and unusual spectral features might point
                    towards Quasars (QSOs) â€“ supermassive black holes surrounded by swirling accretion disks.
